# BELLACIAO

This is a game made for the one button jam 2022.

It's a puzzle game where you need to stop the parts of an image at the correct position to recreate italy's map during the WW2 resistance and ally advance.

This is played only with the spacebar: press the spacebar to start and to lock the images!
